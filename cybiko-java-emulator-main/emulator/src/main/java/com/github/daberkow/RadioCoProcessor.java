/**
 * AVR radio co-processor stub (AT90S2313).
 *
 * Emulates the UART-facing behavior of the AVR radio co-processor on SCI0/SCI2.
 * The Cybiko's H8S CPU communicates with this co-processor using a variable-length
 * command protocol. Command length is determined by the first byte:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code 0x01 XX XX} - 3-byte commands (init, channel, config)</li>
 *   <li>{@code 0x30 XX}    - 2-byte poll command (check for received data)</li>
 *   <li>{@code 0xCF XX}    - 2-byte scan/beacon command (peer discovery)</li>
 *   <li>All other first bytes default to 2-byte length</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Known commands (from SCI0/SCI2 traffic analysis):
 *   0x01 0x04 0x00 - Init command (V2 first boot)
 *   0x01 0x02 0xNN - Channel/config command (V1 + V2 + XT, param = channel)
 *   0x01 0x03 0x00 - V1 second init command
 *   0x30 0x00      - Poll for received frames
 *   0xCF 0x00      - Scan/beacon for peer discovery (Chat)
 *
 * Follows the same transfer() pattern as {@link AT45DB041Flash}: each byte
 * written by the CPU is passed to {@link #transfer(int)}, which returns a
 * response byte or -1 if no response is available yet.
