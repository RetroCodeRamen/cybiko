# Cybiko Emulator & NVRAM Manager

A standalone Java emulator for the [Cybiko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybiko) handheld computer family, plus a desktop NVRAM manager for working with Cybiko flash images. Derived from MAME's emulation by the fantastic Tim Schuerewegen!

Blog post about it: [https://buildingtents.com/2026/07/29/writing-a-cybiko-emulator/](https://buildingtents.com/2026/07/29/writing-a-cybiko-emulator/)

I always loved this device, and wanted to play around with a stand alone emulator to try to port it to a ESP32, and work with real devices using software defined radio. I did use Claude for a lot of it, and
I know people have opinions on AI. This was a project I wanted to do for a while, and never had time for. Claude got it all working, without it the project would not exist.

This is the main repo for me working on this project. A few others have been made for a [C Version](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-c-emulator) and a port to the [LilyGo T-Deck](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-lilygo). Java is my best known language, thus I started here to be able to debug.

Please report issues or feature ideas on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator/issues).

## Current Functionality

| Feature | Classic V1 | V2 | Xtreme |
|---------|:----------:|:--:|:------:|
| Core (boot to interactive UI) | Yes | Yes (CyOS v1.3.57) | Yes |
| Sound (1-bit PWM speaker) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| MP3 Player | No | No | No |
| Radio (LAN/SDR networking) | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| RTC (real-time clock) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| App Loading (CFS + NVRAM) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Keyboard | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| DMA | N/A | N/A | Yes |

**Notes:**
- **V2** fully boots with CyOS v1.3.57. CyOS v1.3.58 stalls at the animated logo (RF hardware init never completes, same as MAME).
- **MP3** playback is not implemented on any variant. Sound is 1-bit PWM only.
- **RTC** shows correct date and time on all variants via I2C (PCF8593). Time advances in real-time during emulation.



## Quick Start

**Requirements:** Java 21+

### 1. Get the ROMs

You need two ROM files per machine variant. These come from MAME ROM sets:

| Machine | ROM Files | MAME ZIP |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Cybiko Xtreme (default) | `cyrom150.bin` + `cyos_v1508.bin` | `cybikoxt.zip` |
| Cybiko Classic V1 | `cyrom112.bin` + `flash_v1246.bin` | `cybiko.zip` |
| Cybiko V2 | `cyrom117.bin` + `cyos_v1357.bin` + `flash_v1357.bin` | `cybikov2.zip` |

ROMs can be found at the [Cybiko Archive on archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cybiko) or in [MAME ROM collections](https://ia803204.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/29/items/mame-0.221-roms-merged/cybikov1.zip).

### 2. Download and Run

Grab the latest `.jar` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator/releases) and place your ROM files in the same folder. This is a single-file fat JAR — no unzipping or extra dependencies needed.

```bash
# Cybiko Xtreme (default)
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar cyrom150.bin cyos_v1508.bin --nvram localmemory.bin

# Cybiko Classic V1
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar --machine v1 cyrom112.bin flash_v1246.bin --nvram localmemory.bin

# Cybiko V2
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar --machine v2 cyrom117.bin cyos_v1357.bin flash_v1357.bin --nvram localmemory.bin

# See Options
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar --help
```

> A full distribution ZIP with launch scripts is also available on the releases page if you prefer that.

### 3. Load Apps (the easy way — NVRAM Manager)

Don't want to deal with command-line flags? The **NVRAM Manager** is a visual app that lets you manage your Cybiko's storage and launch the emulator with a couple of clicks.

1. Download `Cybiko-NVRAM-Manager-*.jar` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator/releases) and put it in the same folder as the emulator JAR and your ROMs
2. Run it: `java -jar Cybiko-NVRAM-Manager-*.jar`
3. Go to **File > New Xtreme Image** (or Classic V1) to create a fresh NVRAM
4. Save it somewhere with **File > Save As**
5. Go to **Library > Add Folder** and point it at a folder of `.app` files from the [Cybiko Archive](https://archive.org/details/cybiko)
6. Browse your apps in the library, select one, and click **Add to NVRAM** — repeat for as many as you want
7. Right-click your NVRAM in the sidebar and hit **Launch Emulator** — it finds the ROMs and emulator JAR automatically

Your apps, clock, and settings are all saved in the NVRAM file between sessions.

### 3b. Load Apps (command line)

If you prefer the terminal, you can load `.app` files directly:

```bash
# Load an app and save to persistent NVRAM
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar cyrom150.bin cyos_v1508.bin --nvram cybiko.nvram --app calc.app

# Next time, just boot — your apps and settings are saved
java -jar Cybiko-Emulator-*.jar cyrom150.bin cyos_v1508.bin --nvram cybiko.nvram
```

### 4. Keyboard

Letters map directly to your keyboard. Arrow keys for navigation, Enter/Space/Tab/Esc as labeled.

- **Xtreme**: Numbers via right Alt + letter (Alt+Q=1, Alt+W=2, ... Alt+P=0)
- **Classic V1**: Dedicated number keys 0-9

## Radio Networking

Radio supports UDP multicast (`--radio lan`) for LAN play and a TCP bridge (`--radio sdr`) for GNU Radio integration.

| Capability | V1 | V2 | XT |
|------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Peer discovery | Yes (cross-version) | Yes (cross-version) | Yes (cross-version) |
| Chat (same version) | Yes | Not tested | Yes |
| Chat (cross-version) | Yes | No | Yes |
| Beacon TX | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Frame data TX | Yes | No (protocol limitation) | Yes (DTC) |
| Frame data RX | Yes (50-byte only) | Yes (50-byte only) | Yes (50/200-byte) |

**Details:**
- **V1↔V1** and **XT↔XT** chat is fully working — nearby peer discovery and messaging confirmed between emulators of the same type.
- **V1↔XT** cross-version chat works — peer discovery and messaging confirmed between Classic V1 and Xtreme emulators.
- **V2↔XT** peer discovery works — both see each other in the Chat nearby list. Chat messaging does not work because V2 (CyOS v1.3.57) and XT (CyOS v1.5.08) use incompatible radio protocols. V2 only sends 2-byte radio commands and cannot transmit frame data. V2 also only supports 50-byte receive frames, while XT sends 192-byte chat frames. **V2 radio requires CyOS v1.3.57 specifically** — the emulator uses hardcoded RAM offsets for CyID patching and beacon data that differ between ROM versions.

## NVRAM Manager

A JavaFX desktop application for managing Cybiko NVRAM/flash images without running the emulator. Browse, add, remove, and inspect files on any Cybiko flash image.

### Quick Start

Grab `Cybiko-NVRAM-Manager-*.jar` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator/releases) and run it:

```bash
java -jar Cybiko-NVRAM-Manager-*.jar
```

Or build from source:

```bash
./gradlew :manager:build
./gradlew :manager:run
```

### Features

- **Open/save/create** NVRAM images (.nvram, .bin, .nv) for all hardware variants (Classic V1/V2, Xtreme)
- **Library folders** -- configure directories of .app files, browse and add to NVRAM with one click
- **Drag-and-drop** -- drag library items onto NVRAM entries in the sidebar to add files directly (multi-select supported)
- **Smart lists** -- "Recently Added" and "Not in Any NVRAM" virtual folders that update automatically
- **Search/filter** -- real-time search across file listings
- **Hex viewer** -- browse raw file data with multi-select and copy to clipboard
- **Integrity validation** -- CyOS-level flash checks: checksums, boot blocks, block flags, file structure, data sizes
- **Flash repair** -- automatically recover files from corrupted images
- **NVRAM properties** -- flash geometry, block stats, checksum status
- **CSV export** -- export file listings
- **Dark theme** -- GitHub-style dark mode UI, Wayland-compatible in-window dialogs

### Supported Flash Types

| Type | Hardware | Page Size | Total Size |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| AT45DB041 | Classic V1/V2 (4Mbit) | 264 bytes | 540 KB |
| AT45DB081 | 8Mbit variant | 264 bytes | 1.05 MB |
| AT45DB161 | 16Mbit variant | 528 bytes | 2.11 MB |
| SST 39VF400A | Xtreme | 258 bytes | 517 KB |

## Building from Source

If you prefer to build from source instead of using the [release zips](https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator/releases):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daberkow/cybiko-java-emulator.git
cd cybiko-java-emulator

# Build everything (requires Java 21, auto-downloaded via Gradle toolchains)
./gradlew build

# Run the emulator from source
./gradlew :emulator:run --args="cyrom150.bin cyos_v1508.bin"

# Run all tests (~186 manager tests + emulator tests)
./gradlew test
```
